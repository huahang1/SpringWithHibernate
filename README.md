# SpringWithHibernate
SpringMVC for the backend and Hibernate for ORM, JUnit for unit testing
# With the help from Dependency Injection(DI), the project has a more clear layered structure, based on the static factory design pattern
#AOP helps manage the transaction part and you can define the pointcut to add more method like self-defined validation
